# Updates
NOTE: 18/05/2023's version is the newest version that is proven to work. The only inconvenience is that the bot gets stopped after sending a dozen messages, to counter this I added an amount of time to wait between messages that you can change in config file, feel free to shoot me a DM on Discord with possible solutions and I'll implement them. <br/>

# In progress
1 - Add an option to use a proxy with the bot. Estimated to be up and running by 10/06/2023<br/>
2 - Add an option to loop through multiple bots, if one banned switch to another. Estimated to be up and running by the month of July<br/>
3 - Add a UI(User Interface). I haven't started working on this, I think the bot will remain a CLI-only tool for now.

# How to use
0 - Have Python and Pip installed. Clone this repository. Run ```pip install -r r.txt```<br/>
1 - Add an account to ```account.py```<br/>
2 - Change what needs to be changed in ```config.py```<br/>
3 - Run ```fillUsernames.csv.py``` to get usernames into ```/db/usernames.csv```, or fill it yourself (:<br/>
4 - Run ```py.py```

# How does it work?
